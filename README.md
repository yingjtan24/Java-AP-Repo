Shopping Cart: The shopping cart is a project focused on using classes, global arrays, accessor and mutator methods. The program has core methods such as getItemName
getItemPrice, getItemQuantity, calculateTotal, calculateAverage, and displayCart. The shopping cart asks user what and how much of an item they want and generates a shopping cart receipt.
 
Quiz Project:
The quiz project was coded on Java Graphics. The Quiz Project focuses on classes such as the question, quiz, and input helper class. The core concepts demonstarted in the quiz projec are accessor and mutator methods as well as classes that are used to acccess and retrieve quesions and correct answers of a short AP Computer Science A quiz. 

Password Generator I and II
- The Password Generator project focuses on the Math.random methods and arrays to generate a random password. The method generateRandomPassword generates a random password using the array of letter, symbols, and numbers using Math.random.  

Magic8Ball
- The Magic 8 Ball project focuses on the Math.random methods and arrays to generate a random 8 ball response to a question from the user.By importing java.util.Scanner, users can ask the program and question and the porgram uses an array and the Math.random method to generate a random or (maybe no so random...) response. 

Graphica 
- The graphics project was created on Java Graphics and focuses on using the Java Graphics application and creating different class functions for each shape. Each shape class in the project is associated with specific parameters, variables, and methods relevant. The project uses 2D arrays, graphics draw functions, class, and subclasses to create a digital pattern.

ChatBox
- The Chatbox project focuses on stimulating a program that chats with the user using the importing java.util.Scanner and arrays with responses and topics.
